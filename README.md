# TravelBuddy: AI Trip Planner

Travel Buddy is our project for CPTS322 at Washington State University, this class project makes trip planning easier by using an AI chat bot. You can tell it where you’re going, your budget, and what you like, and it’ll spit out a custom itinerary with stuff to do, places to stay, and where to eat.
