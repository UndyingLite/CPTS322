## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
Over this sprint, our team (Kaleb, Melvin, Nick, and Zuriel) set up the initial project structure, tackled user authentication, integrated a lightweight AI suggestion component, and established a database for storing user information. One key challenge was ensuring the AI model’s API calls were set up correctly, but after some trial and error, we resolved those integration issues. We also learned how to secure environment variables properly. Overall, collaboration via our Kanban board helped keep tasks organized, and we wrapped up the main deliverables as planned.

## Unfinished Work
We anticipated adding a password-reset email service but did not complete it. We have:
1. Commented on the relevant issue with our progress and challenges.
2. Moved it to the next sprint for completion.
