## Attendees

## Agenda
1. Demonstrate each completed feature.
2. Check acceptance criteria.
3. Discuss any incomplete items.
4. Outline next steps.

## Completed Items
- **PB-1: User Login & Registration**  
  Successfully demoed user registration (with valid emails), login, and basic error handling for invalid inputs.
- **PB-2: Destination Suggestions**  
  Showed how users can enter budget/interests and receive at least two destination recommendations.
- **PB-3: AI Chat**  
  Demonstrated a minimal chat interface; AI suggests budget-friendly travel ideas and handles basic errors.
- **PB-6: Database Integration**  
  Confirmed user registration data and AI chat logs are being stored in the database; tested with multiple records.

## Incomplete Items
- None. All committed items for Sprint 1 were completed successfully.

## Feedback
- **Smooth User Flow**: Registration and login are straightforward, with no critical bugs reported.
- **AI Suggestions**: Functional but limited; consider expanding the dataset or improving responses in future sprints.
- **Destination Input**: Could benefit from form validation (e.g., numeric checks for budget).

## Next Steps
1. **Plan Sprint 2**: Include enhancements for error handling, AI response variety, and more robust UI design.
2. **Address Minor Bugs**: Tackle small UI/UX issues discovered during demos.
3. **Expand Testing**: Incorporate automated tests for user registration and destination suggestion modules.
