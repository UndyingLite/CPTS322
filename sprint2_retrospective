# Sprint 2 Retrospective

**Date**: April 1, 2025  
**Sprint Duration**: March 17 – March 31

---

## 1. What Went Well
- User dashboard, password reset, and profile page were implemented cleanly.
- Flash messaging and improved UI significantly enhanced the experience.
- GitHub commits were consistent, and team collaboration improved.
- Sprint planning and backlog refinement helped clarify responsibilities.

---

## 2. What Didn’t Go Well
- Saved Trips feature was started late and is still incomplete.
- Not all teammates pushed code changes on time, leading to merge delays.
- Some API error handling (Gemini/OpenAI) was inconsistent or lacked fallback UI.

---

## 3. Potential Improvements
1. **Finish Critical Features Earlier**: Push key features into the first week of the sprint.
2. **Enforce Branching & Merge Discipline**: Require teammates to open pull requests rather than direct main edits.
3. **Improve Test Coverage**: Write basic tests or include test cases to validate expected flows.

## 4. Action Items
1. **Finalize Saved Trips implementation** – assigned to **Zuriel**
2. **Add persistent database support (SQLite or MongoDB)** – coordinated by **Kaleb**
3. **Set feature deadlines earlier in Sprint 3** to allow for QA time – agreed by team
4. **Use Git branches and PRs going forward** – enforced by **Melvin**

**Team Sentiment**:  
Sprint 2 felt more cohesive. Everyone built on Sprint 1 foundations, and the project now looks and feels like a functional app. Sprint 3 will focus on data persistence, testing, and remaining features.
